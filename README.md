# CSS Flexbox & Grid Practice
This application is a portfolio page I built as a practice project, particularly in the use of CSS Flexbox and Grid. I designed it first locally on my computer before opening a repository to archive and continue the work done so far.

This is a [link](https://contentcommando.github.io/css-flexbox-grid-practice/ ) to the application.
